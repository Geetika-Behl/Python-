# PYTHON 

## History
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

## Intersting Facts
* Python Started as a Hobby Project: Guido van Rossum started Python as a project during his Christmas holidays in 1989, aiming to create a scripting language that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. It evolved from the ABC language.
*  Python is Named After a TV Show: Python is named after "Monty Python's Flying Circus," a British comedy group that Guido van Rossum admired. It's not named after the snake.
*  Python Has Multiple Variants: Python has various implementations for different platforms and use cases, such as CPython (the standard implementation), Jython (for Java), IronPython (.NET), etc.
*  Python is Older Than Java: Python was released in 1991, while Java was released in 1995, making Python older.
*  Special Slice Operator in Python: Python's slice operator (:) allows for powerful list manipulations, like reversing lists or extracting sublists.
*  Despite Being Slow, Python is Widely Used: Python is slower than compiled languages like C or Java because it's interpreted. Despite this, it's widely used by major companies for application development.
* Python Overtook French in Popularity for Teaching: Python became more popular than French for primary school teaching in 2015, highlighting its importance in education.

## Summary 
<p1> I've learned a lot about Python, from creating virtual environments to importing modules. Each day, I develop my skills further by practicing at least two questions on LeetCode. This daily practice has improved my problem-solving skills and made my decision-making quicker and more efficient. </p1>
